# question.sh
# Ask a question about a line or block of code and get a natural
# language response (but commented for the language).
# Arguments:
#   $1: filetype, e.g. go, py, js
#   $2: filepath, the path to the context file
#   $3: cursor, either a line number (42) or a range (42-45)
#   $4: prompt, i.e. additional input, could be provided by the user or the plugin
#   $5: model, the language model to use
#   $6: base path, the base url for the language model, e.g. https://api.openai.com/v1
# Output: Natural language response from the model to answer question
# Example: ./question.sh go ./foo.go 5-10 "What is the return type?"
# butterfish.nvim command: :BFQuestion

# This is a script for butterfish.nvim, it accepts arguments from the plugin
# constructs language model prompts, and calls Butterfish to generate a response
# using the OpenAI API. You can modify this script to change the prompt, or
# swap in a different language model.

# Source common.sh from the same directory as this script
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/common.sh"

Here is a specific block of code I want to discuss:

\"\"\"
$fileblock
\"\"\"
"

Here is my question: $prompt"

sysmsg="You are helping an expert programmer understand code. Every line of your response should be commented in the style of '$filetype' code. Choose the comment style based on your programming language knowledge. For example, with c or go code, every line would be prefixed with '//'. For python or bash code, every line would be prefixed with '#'. Your entire response will go into a code, so make sure every line is commented.

For example
Here is my question: What is the return type of this c function?

// Answer: The return type is int"

lm_command "$sysmsg" "$fullprompt"
